## About Me

I'm a Bachelor of Technology student at the University of Colombo, specializing in Instrumentation and Automation Technology. My passion lies in crafting intelligent hardware solutions that seamlessly blend electronics and software. I'm deeply involved in the world of Embedded Systems, Robotics, and DevOps. With hands-on experience in microcontroller programming, circuit design, and system integration, I'm always eager to build and innovate.

I am proficient in C and C++, and I'm actively exploring the capabilities of ATmega, ESP32, and STM platforms. A Linux enthusiast with a strong interest in automation and real-time systems, I'm driven by the desire to design reliable and scalable solutions through continuous learning and experimentation.
